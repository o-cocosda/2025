    <h2>Welcome to O-COCOSDA 2025!</h2>
    <p>

Oriental COCOSDA (O-COCOSDA), the Oriental chapter of COCOSDA, an acronym of the International Committee for the Coordination and Standardisation of Speech Databases and Assessment Techniques, was established in 1997.
The purpose of O-COCOSDA is to exchange ideas, share information, and discuss regional matters on the creation, utilization, and dissemination of spoken language corpora of oriental languages and also on the assessment methods of speech recognition/synthesis systems as well as promote speech research on oriental languages.

    </p>

The annual Oriental COCOSDA international conference is the flag conference of Oriental COCOSDA.
The first preparatory meeting was held in Hong Kong in 1997 and then the past 27 workshops were held in Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, China, Nepal, Taiwan, Macau, India, Thailand, China, Malaysia, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam India, and Taiwan.
The 28th Oriental COCOSDA Conference is returning to Indonesia and will be held on Oct. 23-25, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia hosted by the Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia.
