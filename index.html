        <h4>About Oriental COCOSDA</h4>
    </p>
    Oriental COCOSDA (O-COCOSDA) is the Oriental branch of COCOSDA, which stands for the International Committee for the Coordination and Standardisation of Speech Databases and Assessment Techniques. Established in 1997, its primary goal is to foster idea exchange, share insights, and discuss regional matters related to the creation, use, and distribution of spoken language corpora for Oriental languages. Additionally, O-COCOSDA focuses on assessing speech recognition and synthesis systems while promoting speech research in Oriental languages.

        <h4>About the Conference</h4>
    </p>  
    The annual Oriental COCOSDA International Conference is the flagship event of O-COCOSDA.  
    The first preparatory meeting took place in Hong Kong in 1997, and since then, 27 workshops have been hosted in various countries, including Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Nepal, Macau, Myanmar, and the Philippines. This year, the 28th edition of the conference returns to Indonesia, specifically Yogyakarta, with Gadjah Mada University as the host.
